ATTACK REPLIED THE PRINCE NOT IN THE LEAST DISCONCERTED BY THIS RECEPTION HE HAD JUST ENTERED WEARING AN EMBROIDERED COURT UNIFORM KNEE BREECHES AND SHOES AND HAD STARS ON HIS BREAST AND A SERENE EXPRESSION ON HIS FLAT FACE HE SPOKE IN THAT REFINED FRENCH IN WHICH OUR GRANDFATHERS NOT ONLY SPOKE BUT THOUGHT AND WITH THE GENTLE PATRONIZING INTONATION NATURAL TO A MAN OF IMPORTANCE WHO HAD GROWN OLD IN SOCIETY AND AT COURT HE WENT UP TO ANNA P VLOVNA KISSED HER HAND PRESENTING TO HER HIS BALD SCENTED AND SHINING HEAD AND COMPLACENTLY SEATED HIMSELF ON THE SOFA FIRST OF ALL DEAR FRIEND TELL ME HOW YOU ARE SET YOUR FRIEND S MIND AT REST SAID HE WITHOUT ALTERING HIS TONE BENEATH THE POLITENESS AND AFFECTED SYMPATHY OF WHICH INDIFFERENCE AND EVEN IRONY COULD BE DISCERNED CAN ONE BE WELL WHILE SUFFERING MORALLY CAN ONE BE CALM IN TIMES LIKE THESE IF ONE HAS ANY FEELING SAID ANNA P VLOVNA YOU ARE STAYING THE WHOLE EVENING I HOPE AND THE FETE AT THE ENGLISH AMBASSADOR S TODAY IS WEDNESDAY I MUST PUT IN AN APPEARANCE THERE SAID THE PRINCE MY DAUGHTER IS COMING FOR ME TO TAKE ME THERE I THOUGHT TODAY S FETE HAD BEEN CANCELED I CONFESS ALL THESE FESTIVITIES AND FIREWORKS ARE BECOMING WEARISOME IF THEY HAD KNOWN THAT YOU WISHED IT THE ENTERTAINMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN PUT OFF SAID THE PRINCE WHO LIKE A WOUND UP CLOCK BY FORCE OF HABIT SAID THINGS HE DID NOT EVEN WISH TO BE BELIEVED DON T TEASE WELL AND WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED ABOUT NOVOS LTSEV S DISPATCH YOU KNOW EVERYTHING WHAT CAN ONE SAY ABOUT IT REPLIED THE PRINCE IN A COLD LISTLESS TONE WHAT HAS BEEN DECIDED THEY HAVE DECIDED THAT BUONAPARTE HAS BURNT HIS BOATS AND I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE READY TO BURN OURS PRINCE VAS LI ALWAYS SPOKE LANGUIDLY LIKE AN ACTOR REPEATING A STALE PART ANNA P VLOVNA SCH RER ON THE CONTRARY DESPITE HER FORTY YEARS OVERFLOWED WITH ANIMATION AND IMPULSIVENESS TO BE AN ENTHUSIAST HAD BECOME HER SOCIAL VOCATION AND SOMETIMES EVEN WHEN SHE DID NOT FEEL LIKE IT SHE BECAME ENTHUSIASTIC IN ORDER NOT TO DISAPPOINT THE EXPECTATIONS OF THOSE WHO KNEW HER THE SUBDUED SMILE WHICH THOUGH IT DID NOT SUIT HER FADED FEATURES ALWAYS PLAYED ROUND HER LIPS EXPRESSED AS IN A SPOILED CHILD A CONTINUAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER CHARMING DEFECT WHICH SHE NEITHER WISHED NOR COULD NOR CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO CORRECT IN THE MIDST OF A CONVERSATION ON POLITICAL MATTERS ANNA P VLOVNA BURST OUT OH DON T SPEAK TO ME OF AUSTRIA PERHAPS I DON T UNDERSTAND THINGS BUT AUSTRIA NEVER HAS WISHED AND DOES NOT WISH FOR WAR SHE IS BETRAYING US RUSSIA ALONE MUST SAVE EUROPE OUR GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN RECOGNIZES HIS HIGH VOCATION AND WILL BE TRUE TO IT THAT IS THE ONE THING I HAVE FAITH IN OUR GOOD AND WONDERFUL SOVEREIGN HAS TO PERFORM THE NOBLEST ROLE ON EARTH AND HE IS SO VIRTUOUS AND NOBLE THAT GOD WILL NOT FORSAKE HIM HE WILL FULFILL HIS VOCATION AND CRUSH THE HYDRA OF REVOLUTION WHICH HAS BECOME MORE TERRIBLE THAN EVER IN THE PERSON OF THIS MURDERER AND VILLAIN WE ALONE MUST AVENGE THE BLOOD OF THE JUST ONE WHOM I ASK YOU CAN WE RELY ON ENGLAND WITH HER COMMERCIAL SPIRIT WILL NOT AND CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER S LOFTINESS OF SOUL SHE HAS REFUSED TO EVACUATE MALTA SHE WANTED TO FIND AND STILL SEEKS SOME SECRET MOTIVE IN OUR ACTIONS WHAT ANSWER DID NOVOS LTSEV GET NONE THE ENGLISH HAVE NOT UNDERSTOOD AND CANNOT UNDERSTAND THE SELF ABNEGATION OF OUR EMPEROR WHO WANTS NOTHING FOR HIMSELF BUT ONLY DESIRES THE GOOD OF MANKIND AND WHAT HAVE THEY PROMISED NOTHING AND WHAT LITTLE THEY HAVE PROMISED THEY WILL NOT PERFORM PRUSSIA HAS ALWAYS DECLARED THAT BUONAPARTE IS INVINCIBLE AND THAT ALL EUROPE IS POWERLESS BEFORE HIM AND I DON T BELIEVE A WORD THAT HARDENBURG SAYS OR HAUGWITZ EITHER THIS FAMOUS PRUSSIAN NEUTRALITY IS JUST A TRAP I HAVE FAITH ONLY IN GOD AND THE LOFTY DESTINY OF OUR ADORED MONARCH HE WILL SAVE EUROPE SHE SUDDENLY PAUSED SMILING AT HER OWN IMPETUOSITY I THINK SAID THE PRINCE WITH A SMILE THAT IF YOU HAD BEEN SENT INSTEAD OF OUR DEAR WINTZINGERODE YOU WOULD HAVE CAPTURED THE KING OF PRUSSIA S CONSENT BY ASSAULT YOU ARE SO ELOQUENT WILL YOU GIVE ME A CUP OF TEA IN A MOMENT PROPOS SHE ADDED BECOMING CALM AGAIN I AM EXPECTING TWO VERY INTERESTING MEN TONIGHT LE VICOMTE DE MORTEMART WHO IS CONNECTED WITH THE MONTMORENCYS THROUGH THE ROHANS ONE OF THE BEST FRENCH FAMILIES HE IS ONE OF THE GENUINE MIGR S THE GOOD ONES AND ALSO THE ABB MORIO DO YOU KNOW THAT PROFOUND THINKER HE HAS BEEN RECEIVED BY THE EMPEROR HAD YOU HEARD I SHALL BE DELIGHTED TO MEET THEM SAID THE PRINCE BUT TELL ME HE ADDED WITH STUDIED CARELESSNESS AS IF IT HAD ONLY JUST OCCURRED TO HIM THOUGH THE QUESTION HE WAS ABOUT TO ASK WAS THE CHIEF MOTIVE OF HIS VISIT IS IT TRUE THAT THE DOWAGER EMPRESS WANTS BARON FUNKE TO BE APPOINTED FIRST SECRETARY AT VIENNA THE BARON BY ALL ACCOUNTS IS A POOR CREATURE PRINCE VAS LI WISHED TO OBTAIN THIS POST FOR HIS SON BUT OTHERS WERE TRYING THROUGH THE DOWAGER EMPRESS M RYA F DOROVNA TO SECURE IT FOR THE BARON ANNA P VLOVNA ALMOST CLOSED HER EYES TO INDICATE THAT NEITHER SHE NOR ANYONE ELSE HAD A RIGHT TO CRITICIZE WHAT THE EMPRESS DESIRED OR WAS PLEASED WITH BARON FUNKE HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED TO THE DOWAGER EMPRESS BY HER SISTER WAS ALL SHE SAID IN A DRY AND MOURNFUL TONE AS SHE NAMED THE EMPRESS ANNA P VLOVNA S FACE SUDDENLY ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF PROFOUND AND SINCERE DEVOTION AND RESPECT MINGLED WITH SADNESS AND THIS OCCURRED EVERY TIME SHE MENTIONED HER ILLUSTRIOUS PATRONESS SHE ADDED THAT HER MAJESTY HAD DEIGNED TO SHOW BARON FUNKE BEAUCOUP D ESTIME AND AGAIN HER FACE CLOUDED OVER WITH SADNESS THE PRINCE WAS SILENT AND LOOKED INDIFFERENT BUT WITH THE WOMANLY AND COURTIERLIKE QUICKNESS AND TACT HABITUAL TO HER ANNA P VLOVNA WISHED BOTH TO REBUKE HIM FOR DARING TO SPEAK AS HE HAD DONE OF A MAN RECOMMENDED TO THE EMPRESS AND AT THE SAME TIME TO CONSOLE HIM SO SHE SAID NOW ABOUT YOUR FAMILY DO YOU KNOW THAT SINCE YOUR DAUGHTER CAME OUT EVERYONE HAS BEEN ENRAPTURED BY HER THEY SAY SHE IS AMAZINGLY BEAUTIFUL THE PRINCE BOWED TO SIGNIFY HIS RESPECT AND GRATITUDE I OFTEN THINK SHE CONTINUED AFTER A SHORT PAUSE DRAWING NEARER TO THE PRINCE AND SMILING AMIABLY AT HIM AS IF TO SHOW THAT POLITICAL AND SOCIAL TOPICS WERE ENDED AND THE TIME HAD COME FOR INTIMATE CONVERSATION I OFTEN THINK HOW UNFAIRLY SOMETIMES THE JOYS OF LIFE ARE DISTRIBUTED WHY HAS FATE GIVEN YOU TWO SUCH SPLENDID CHILDREN I DON T SPEAK OF ANATOLE YOUR YOUNGEST I DON T LIKE HIM SHE ADDED IN A TONE ADMITTING OF NO REJOINDER AND RAISING HER EYEBROWS TWO SUCH CHARMING CHILDREN AND REALLY YOU APPRECIATE THEM LESS THAN ANYONE AND SO YOU DON T DESERVE TO HAVE THEM AND SHE SMILED HER ECSTATIC SMILE I CAN T HELP IT SAID THE PRINCE LAVATER WOULD HAVE SAID I LACK THE BUMP OF PATERNITY DON T JOKE I MEAN TO HAVE A SERIOUS TALK WITH YOU DO YOU KNOW I AM DISSATISFIED WITH YOUR YOUNGER SON BETWEEN OURSELVES AND HER FACE ASSUMED ITS MELANCHOLY EXPRESSION HE WAS MENTIONED AT HER MAJESTY S AND YOU WERE PITIED THE PRINCE ANSWERED NOTHING BUT SHE LOOKED AT HIM SIGNIFICANTLY AWAITING A REPLY HE FROWNED WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO HE SAID AT LAST YOU KNOW I DID ALL A FATHER COULD FOR THEIR EDUCATION AND THEY HAVE BOTH TURNED OUT FOOLS HIPPOLYTE IS AT LEAST A QUIET FOOL BUT ANATOLE IS AN ACTIVE ONE THAT IS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM HE SAID THIS SMILING IN A WAY MORE NATURAL AND ANIMATED THAN USUAL SO THAT THE WRINKLES ROUND HIS MOUTH VERY CLEARLY REVEALED SOMETHING UNEXPECTEDLY COARSE AND UNPLEASANT AND WHY ARE CHILDREN BORN TO SUCH MEN AS YOU IF YOU WERE NOT A FATHER THERE WOULD BE NOTHING I COULD REPROACH YOU WITH SAID ANNA P VLOVNA LOOKING UP PENSIVELY I AM YOUR FAITHFUL SLAVE AND TO YOU ALONE I CAN CONFESS THAT MY CHILDREN ARE THE BANE OF MY LIFE IT IS THE CROSS I HAVE TO BEAR THAT IS HOW I EXPLAIN IT TO MYSELF IT CAN T BE HELPED HE SAID NO MORE BUT EXPRESSED HIS RESIGNATION TO CRUEL FATE BY A GESTURE ANNA P VLOVNA MEDITATED HAVE YOU NEVER THOUGHT OF MARRYING YOUR PRODIGAL SON ANATOLE SHE ASKED THEY SAY OLD MAIDS HAVE A MANIA FOR MATCHMAKING AND THOUGH I DON T FEEL THAT WEAKNESS IN MYSELF AS YET I KNOW A LITTLE PERSON WHO IS VERY UNHAPPY WITH HER FATHER SHE IS A RELATION OF YOURS PRINCESS MARY BOLK NSKAYA PRINCE VAS LI DID NOT REPLY THOUGH WITH THE QUICKNESS OF MEMORY AND PERCEPTION BEFITTING A MAN OF THE WORLD HE INDICATED BY A MOVEMENT OF THE HEAD THAT HE WAS CONSIDERING THIS INFORMATION DO YOU KNOW HE SAID AT LAST EVIDENTLY UNABLE TO CHECK THE SAD CURRENT OF HIS THOUGHTS THAT ANATOLE IS COSTING ME FORTY THOUSAND RUBLES A YEAR AND HE WENT ON AFTER A PAUSE WHAT WILL IT BE IN FIVE YEARS IF HE GOES ON LIKE THIS PRESENTLY HE ADDED THAT S WHAT WE FATHERS HAVE TO PUT UP WITH IS THIS PRINCESS OF YOURS RICH HER FATHER IS VERY RICH AND STINGY HE LIVES IN THE COUNTRY HE IS THE WELL KNOWN PRINCE BOLK NSKI WHO HAD TO RETIRE FROM THE ARMY UNDER THE LATE EMPEROR AND WAS NICKNAMED THE KING OF PRUSSIA HE IS VERY CLEVER BUT ECCENTRIC AND A BORE THE POOR GIRL IS VERY UNHAPPY SHE HAS A BROTHER I

PETERSBURG TO EACH NEW ARRIVAL ANNA P VLOVNA SAID YOU HAVE NOT YET SEEN MY AUNT OR YOU DO NOT KNOW MY AUNT AND VERY GRAVELY CONDUCTED HIM OR HER TO A LITTLE OLD LADY WEARING LARGE BOWS OF RIBBON IN HER CAP WHO HAD COME SAILING IN FROM ANOTHER ROOM AS SOON AS THE GUESTS BEGAN TO ARRIVE AND SLOWLY TURNING HER EYES FROM THE VISITOR TO HER AUNT ANNA P VLOVNA MENTIONED EACH ONE S NAME AND THEN LEFT THEM EACH VISITOR PERFORMED THE CEREMONY OF GREETING THIS OLD AUNT WHOM NOT ONE OF THEM KNEW NOT ONE OF THEM WANTED TO KNOW AND NOT ONE OF THEM CARED ABOUT ANNA P VLOVNA OBSERVED THESE GREETINGS WITH MOURNFUL AND SOLEMN INTEREST AND SILENT APPROVAL THE AUNT SPOKE TO EACH OF THEM IN THE SAME WORDS ABOUT THEIR HEALTH AND HER OWN AND THE HEALTH OF HER MAJESTY WHO THANK GOD WAS BETTER TODAY AND EACH VISITOR THOUGH POLITENESS PREVENTED HIS SHOWING IMPATIENCE LEFT THE OLD WOMAN WITH A SENSE OF RELIEF AT HAVING PERFORMED A VEXATIOUS DUTY AND DID NOT RETURN TO HER THE WHOLE EVENING THE YOUNG PRINCESS BOLK NSKAYA HAD BROUGHT SOME WORK IN A GOLD EMBROIDERED VELVET BAG HER PRETTY LITTLE UPPER LIP ON WHICH A DELICATE DARK DOWN WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE WAS TOO SHORT FOR HER TEETH BUT IT LIFTED ALL THE MORE SWEETLY AND WAS ESPECIALLY CHARMING WHEN SHE OCCASIONALLY DREW IT DOWN TO MEET THE LOWER LIP AS IS ALWAYS THE CASE WITH A THOROUGHLY ATTRACTIVE WOMAN HER DEFECT THE SHORTNESS OF HER UPPER LIP AND HER HALF OPEN MOUTH SEEMED TO BE HER OWN SPECIAL AND PECULIAR FORM OF BEAUTY EVERYONE BRIGHTENED AT THE SIGHT OF THIS PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN SO SOON TO BECOME A MOTHER SO FULL OF LIFE AND HEALTH AND CARRYING HER BURDEN SO LIGHTLY OLD MEN AND DULL DISPIRITED YOUNG ONES WHO LOOKED AT HER AFTER BEING IN HER COMPANY AND TALKING TO HER A LITTLE WHILE FELT AS IF THEY TOO WERE BECOMING LIKE HER FULL OF LIFE AND HEALTH ALL WHO TALKED TO HER AND AT EACH WORD SAW HER BRIGHT SMILE AND THE CONSTANT GLEAM OF HER WHITE TEETH THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE IN A SPECIALLY AMIABLE MOOD THAT DAY THE LITTLE PRINCESS WENT ROUND THE TABLE WITH QUICK SHORT SWAYING STEPS HER WORKBAG ON HER ARM AND GAILY SPREADING OUT HER DRESS SAT DOWN ON A SOFA NEAR THE SILVER SAMOVAR AS IF ALL SHE WAS DOING WAS A PLEASURE TO HERSELF AND TO ALL AROUND HER I HAVE BROUGHT MY WORK SAID SHE IN FRENCH DISPLAYING HER BAG AND ADDRESSING ALL PRESENT MIND ANNETTE I HOPE YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED A WICKED TRICK ON ME SHE ADDED TURNING TO HER HOSTESS YOU WROTE THAT IT WAS TO BE QUITE A SMALL RECEPTION AND JUST SEE HOW BADLY I AM DRESSED AND SHE SPREAD OUT HER ARMS TO SHOW HER SHORT WAISTED LACE TRIMMED DAINTY GRAY DRESS GIRDLED WITH A BROAD RIBBON JUST BELOW THE BREAST SOYEZ TRANQUILLE LISE YOU WILL ALWAYS BE PRETTIER THAN ANYONE ELSE REPLIED ANNA P VLOVNA YOU KNOW SAID THE PRINCESS IN THE SAME TONE OF VOICE AND STILL IN FRENCH TURNING TO A GENERAL MY HUSBAND IS DESERTING ME HE IS GOING TO GET HIMSELF KILLED TELL ME WHAT THIS WRETCHED WAR IS FOR SHE ADDED ADDRESSING PRINCE VAS LI AND WITHOUT WAITING FOR AN ANSWER SHE TURNED TO SPEAK TO HIS DAUGHTER THE BEAUTIFUL H L NE WHAT A DELIGHTFUL WOMAN THIS LITTLE PRINCESS IS SAID PRINCE VAS LI TO ANNA P VLOVNA ONE OF THE NEXT ARRIVALS WAS A STOUT HEAVILY BUILT YOUNG MAN WITH CLOSE CROPPED HAIR SPECTACLES THE LIGHT COLORED BREECHES FASHIONABLE AT THAT TIME A VERY HIGH RUFFLE AND A BROWN DRESS COAT THIS STOUT YOUNG MAN WAS AN ILLEGITIMATE SON OF COUNT BEZ KHOV A WELL KNOWN GRANDEE OF CATHERINE S TIME WHO NOW LAY DYING IN MOSCOW THE YOUNG MAN HAD NOT YET ENTERED EITHER THE MILITARY OR CIVIL SERVICE AS HE HAD ONLY JUST RETURNED FROM ABROAD WHERE HE HAD BEEN EDUCATED AND THIS WAS HIS FIRST APPEARANCE IN SOCIETY ANNA P VLOVNA GREETED HIM WITH THE NOD SHE ACCORDED TO THE LOWEST HIERARCHY IN HER DRAWING ROOM BUT IN SPITE OF THIS LOWEST GRADE GREETING A LOOK OF ANXIETY AND FEAR AS AT THE SIGHT OF SOMETHING TOO LARGE AND UNSUITED TO THE PLACE CAME OVER HER FACE WHEN SHE SAW PIERRE ENTER THOUGH HE WAS CERTAINLY RATHER BIGGER THAN THE OTHER MEN IN THE ROOM HER ANXIETY COULD ONLY HAVE REFERENCE TO THE CLEVER THOUGH SHY BUT OBSERVANT AND NATURAL EXPRESSION WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIM FROM EVERYONE ELSE IN THAT DRAWING ROOM IT IS VERY GOOD OF YOU MONSIEUR PIERRE TO COME AND VISIT A POOR INVALID SAID ANNA P VLOVNA EXCHANGING AN ALARMED GLANCE WITH HER AUNT AS SHE CONDUCTED HIM TO HER PIERRE MURMURED SOMETHING UNINTELLIGIBLE AND CONTINUED TO LOOK ROUND AS IF IN SEARCH OF SOMETHING ON HIS WAY TO THE AUNT HE BOWED TO THE LITTLE PRINCESS WITH A PLEASED SMILE AS TO AN INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE ANNA P VLOVNA S ALARM WAS JUSTIFIED FOR PIERRE TURNED AWAY FROM THE AUNT WITHOUT WAITING TO HEAR HER SPEECH ABOUT HER MAJESTY S HEALTH ANNA P VLOVNA IN DISMAY DETAINED HIM WITH THE WORDS DO YOU KNOW THE ABB MORIO HE IS A MOST INTERESTING MAN YES I HAVE HEARD OF HIS SCHEME FOR PERPETUAL PEACE AND IT IS VERY INTERESTING BUT HARDLY FEASIBLE YOU THINK SO REJOINED ANNA P VLOVNA IN ORDER TO SAY SOMETHING AND GET AWAY TO ATTEND TO HER DUTIES AS HOSTESS BUT PIERRE NOW COMMITTED A REVERSE ACT OF IMPOLITENESS FIRST HE HAD LEFT A LADY BEFORE SHE HAD FINISHED SPEAKING TO HIM AND NOW HE CONTINUED TO SPEAK TO ANOTHER WHO WISHED TO GET AWAY WITH HIS HEAD BENT AND HIS BIG FEET SPREAD APART HE BEGAN EXPLAINING HIS REASONS FOR THINKING THE ABB S PLAN CHIMERICAL WE WILL TALK OF IT LATER SAID ANNA P VLOVNA WITH A SMILE AND HAVING GOT RID OF THIS YOUNG MAN WHO DID NOT KNOW HOW TO BEHAVE SHE RESUMED HER DUTIES AS HOSTESS AND CONTINUED TO LISTEN AND WATCH READY TO HELP AT ANY POINT WHERE THE CONVERSATION MIGHT HAPPEN TO FLAG AS THE FOREMAN OF A SPINNING MILL WHEN HE HAS SET THE HANDS TO WORK GOES ROUND AND NOTICES HERE A SPINDLE THAT HAS STOPPED OR THERE ONE THAT CREAKS OR MAKES MORE NOISE THAN IT SHOULD AND HASTENS TO CHECK THE MACHINE OR SET IT IN PROPER MOTION SO ANNA P VLOVNA MOVED ABOUT HER DRAWING ROOM APPROACHING NOW A SILENT NOW A TOO NOISY GROUP AND BY A WORD OR SLIGHT REARRANGEMENT KEPT THE CONVERSATIONAL MACHINE IN STEADY PROPER AND REGULAR MOTION BUT AMID THESE CARES HER ANXIETY ABOUT PIERRE WAS EVIDENT SHE KEPT AN ANXIOUS WATCH ON HIM WHEN HE APPROACHED THE GROUP ROUND MORTEMART TO LISTEN TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID THERE AND AGAIN WHEN HE PASSED TO ANOTHER GROUP WHOSE CENTER WAS THE ABB PIERRE HAD BEEN EDUCATED ABROAD AND THIS RECEPTION AT ANNA P VLOVNA S WAS THE FIRST HE HAD ATTENDED IN RUSSIA HE KNEW THAT ALL THE INTELLECTUAL LIGHTS OF PETERSBURG WERE GATHERED THERE AND LIKE A CHILD IN A TOYSHOP DID NOT KNOW WHICH WAY TO LOOK AFRAID OF MISSING ANY CLEVER CONVERSATION THAT WAS TO BE HEARD SEEING THE SELF CONFIDENT AND REFINED EXPRESSION ON THE FACES OF THOSE PRESENT HE WAS ALWAYS EXPECTING TO HEAR SOMETHING VERY PROFOUND AT LAST HE CAME UP TO MORIO HERE THE CONVERSATION SEEMED INTERESTING AND HE STOOD WAITING FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPRESS HIS OWN VIEWS AS YOUNG PEOPLE ARE FOND OF DOING CHAPTER III ANNA P VLOVNA S RECEPTION WAS IN FULL SWING THE SPINDLES HUMMED STEADILY AND CEASELESSLY ON ALL SIDES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE AUNT BESIDE WHOM SAT ONLY ONE ELDERLY LADY WHO WITH HER THIN CAREWORN FACE WAS RATHER OUT OF PLACE IN THIS BRILLIANT SOCIETY THE WHOLE COMPANY HAD SETTLED INTO THREE GROUPS ONE CHIEFLY MASCULINE HAD FORMED ROUND THE ABB ANOTHER OF YOUNG PEOPLE WAS GROUPED ROUND THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS H L NE PRINCE VAS LI S DAUGHTER AND THE LITTLE PRINCESS BOLK NSKAYA VERY PRETTY AND ROSY THOUGH RATHER TOO PLUMP FOR HER AGE THE THIRD GROUP WAS GATHERED ROUND MORTEMART AND ANNA P VLOVNA THE VICOMTE WAS A NICE LOOKING YOUNG MAN WITH SOFT FEATURES AND POLISHED MANNERS WHO EVIDENTLY CONSIDERED HIMSELF A CELEBRITY BUT OUT OF POLITENESS MODESTLY PLACED HIMSELF AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE CIRCLE IN WHICH HE FOUND HIMSELF ANNA P VLOVNA WAS OBVIOUSLY SERVING HIM UP AS A TREAT TO HER GUESTS AS A CLEVER MA TRE D H TEL SERVES UP AS A SPECIALLY CHOICE DELICACY A PIECE OF MEAT THAT NO ONE WHO HAD SEEN IT IN THE KITCHEN WOULD HAVE CARED TO EAT SO ANNA P VLOVNA SERVED UP TO HER GUESTS FIRST THE VICOMTE AND THEN THE ABB AS PECULIARLY CHOICE MORSELS THE GROUP ABOUT MORTEMART IMMEDIATELY BEGAN DISCUSSING THE MURDER OF THE DUC D ENGHIEN THE VICOMTE SAID THAT THE DUC D ENGHIEN HAD PERISHED BY HIS OWN MAGNANIMITY AND THAT THERE WERE PARTICULAR REASONS FOR BUONAPARTE S HATRED OF HIM AH YES DO TELL US ALL ABOUT IT VICOMTE SAID ANNA P VLOVNA WITH A PLEASANT FEELING THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING LA LOUIS XV IN THE SOUND OF THAT SENTENCE CONTEZ NOUS ELA VICOMTE THE VICOMTE BOWED AND SMILED COURTEOUSLY IN TOKEN OF HIS WILLINGNESS TO COMPLY ANNA P VLOVNA ARRANGED A GROUP ROUND HIM INVITING EVERYONE TO LISTEN TO HIS TALE THE VICOMTE KNEW THE DUC PERSONALLY WHISPERED ANNA P VLOVNA TO ONE OF THE GUESTS THE VICOMTE IS A WONDERFUL RACONTEUR SAID SHE TO ANOTHER HOW EVIDENTLY HE BELONGS TO THE BEST SOCIETY SAID SHE TO A THIRD AND THE VICOMTE WAS SERVED UP TO THE COMPANY IN THE CHOICEST AND MOST ADVANTAGEOUS STYLE LIKE A WELL GARNISHED JOINT OF ROAST BEEF ON A HOT DISH THE VICOMTE WISHED TO BEGIN HIS STORY AND GAVE A SUBTLE SMILE COME OVER HERE H L NE DEAR SAID ANNA P VLOVNA TO THE BEAUTIFUL YOUNG PRINCESS WHO WAS SITTING SOME WAY OFF THE CENTER OF ANOTHER GROUP THE PRINCESS SMILED SHE ROSE WITH THE SAME UNCHANGING SMILE WITH WHICH SHE HAD FIRST ENTERED THE ROOM THE SMILE OF A PERFECTLY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN WITH A SLIGHT RUSTLE OF HER WHITE DRESS TRIMMED WITH MOSS AND IVY WITH A GLEAM OF WHITE SHOULDERS GLOSSY HAIR AND SPARKLING DIAMONDS SHE PASSED BETWEEN THE MEN WHO MADE WAY FOR HER NOT LOOKING AT ANY OF THEM BUT SMILING ON ALL AS IF GRACIOUSLY ALLOWING EACH THE PRIVILEGE OF ADMIRING HER BEAUTIFUL FIGURE AND SHAPELY SHOULDERS BACK AND BOSOM WHICH IN THE FASHION OF THOSE DAYS WERE VERY MUCH EXPOSED AND SHE SEEMED TO BRING THE GLAMOUR OF A BALLROOM WITH HER AS SHE MOVED TOWARD ANNA P VLOVNA H L NE WAS SO LOVELY THAT NOT ONLY DID SHE NOT SHOW ANY TRACE OF COQUETRY BUT ON THE CONTRARY SHE EVEN APPEARED SHY OF HER UNQUESTIONABLE AND ALL TOO VICTORIOUS BEAUTY SHE SEEMED TO WISH BUT TO BE UNABLE TO DIMINISH ITS EFFECT HOW LOVELY SAID EVERYONE WHO SAW HER AND THE VICOMTE LIFTED HIS SHOULDERS AND DROPPED HIS EYES AS IF STARTLED BY SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY WHEN SHE TOOK HER SEAT OPPOSITE AND BEAMED UPON HIM ALSO WITH HER UNCHANGING SMILE MADAME I DOUBT MY ABILITY BEFORE SUCH AN AUDIENCE SAID HE SMILINGLY INCLINING HIS HEAD THE PRINCESS RESTED HER BARE ROUND ARM ON A LITTLE TABLE AND CONSIDERED A REPLY UNNECESSARY SHE SMILINGLY WAITED ALL THE TIME THE STORY WAS BEING TOLD SHE SAT UPRIGHT GLANCING NOW AT HER BEAUTIFUL ROUND ARM ALTERED IN SHAPE BY ITS PRESSURE ON THE TABLE NOW AT HER STILL MORE BEAUTIFUL BOSOM ON WHICH SHE READJUSTED A DIAMOND NECKLACE FROM TIME TO TIME SHE SMOOTHED THE FOLDS OF HER DRESS AND WHENEVER THE STORY PRODUCED AN EFFECT SHE GLANCED AT ANNA P VLOVNA AT ONCE ADOPTED JUST THE EXPRESSION SHE SAW ON THE MAID OF HONOR S FACE AND AGAIN RELAPSED INTO HER RADIANT SMILE THE LITTLE PRINCESS HAD ALSO LEFT THE TEA TABLE AND FOLLOWED H L NE WAIT A MOMENT I LL GET MY WORK NOW THEN WHAT ARE YOU THINKING OF SHE WENT ON TURNING TO PRINCE HIPPOLYTE FETCH ME MY WORKBAG THERE WAS A GENERAL MOVEMENT AS THE PRINCESS SMILING AND TALKING MERRILY TO EVERYONE AT ONCE SAT DOWN AND GAILY ARRANGED HERSELF IN HER SEAT NOW I AM ALL RIGHT SHE SAID AND ASKING THE VICOMTE TO BEGIN SHE TOOK UP HER WORK PRINCE HIPPOLYTE HAVING BROUGHT THE WORKBAG JOINED THE CIRCLE AND MOVING A CHAIR CLOSE TO HERS SEATED HIMSELF BESIDE HER LE CHARMANT HIPPOLYTE WAS SURPRISING BY HIS EXTRAORDINARY RESEMBLANCE TO HIS BEAUTIFUL SISTER BUT YET MORE BY THE FACT THAT IN SPITE OF THIS RESEMBLANCE HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY UGLY HIS FEATURES WERE LIKE HIS SISTER S BUT WHILE IN HER CASE EVERYTHING WAS LIT UP BY A JOYOUS SELF SATISFIED YOUTHFUL AND CONSTANT SMILE OF ANIMATION AND BY THE WONDERFUL CLASSIC BEAUTY OF HER FIGURE HIS FACE ON THE CONTRARY WAS DULLED BY IMBECILITY AND A CONSTANT EXPRESSION OF SULLEN SELF CONFIDENCE WHILE HIS BODY WAS THIN AND WEAK HIS EYES NOSE AND MOUTH ALL SEEMED PUCKERED INTO A VACANT WEARIED GRIMACE AND HIS ARMS AND LEGS ALWAYS FELL INTO UNNATURAL POSITIONS IT S NOT GOING TO BE A GHOST STORY SAID HE SITTING DOWN BESIDE THE PRINCESS AND HASTILY ADJUSTING HIS LORGNETTE AS IF WITHOUT THIS INSTRUMENT HE COULD NOT BEGIN TO SPEAK WHY NO MY DEAR FELLOW SAID THE ASTONISHED NARRATOR SHRUGGING HIS SHOULDERS BECAUSE I HATE GHOST STORIES SAID PRINCE HIPPOLYTE IN A TONE WHICH SHOWED THAT HE ONLY UNDERSTOOD THE MEANING OF HIS WORDS AFTER HE HAD UTTERED THEM HE SPOKE WITH SUCH SELF CONFIDENCE THAT HIS HEARERS COULD NOT BE SURE WHETHER WHAT HE SAID WAS VERY WITTY OR VERY STUPID HE WAS DRESSED IN A DARK GREEN DRESS COAT KNEE BREECHES OF THE COLOR OF CUISSE DE NYMPHE EFFRAY E AS HE CALLED IT SHOES AND SILK STOCKINGS THE VICOMTE TOLD HIS TALE VERY NEATLY IT WAS AN ANECDOTE THEN CURRENT TO THE EFFECT THAT THE DUC D ENGHIEN HAD GONE SECRETLY TO PARIS TO VISIT MADEMOISELLE GEORGE THAT AT HER HOUSE HE CAME UPON BONAPARTE WHO ALSO ENJOYED THE FAMOUS ACTRESS FAVORS AND THAT IN HIS PRESENCE NAPOLEON HAPPENED TO FALL INTO ONE OF THE FAINTING FITS TO WHICH HE WAS SUBJECT AND WAS THUS AT THE DUC S MERCY THE LATTER SPARED HIM AND THIS MAGNANIMITY BONAPARTE SUBSEQUENTLY REPAID BY DEATH THE STORY WAS VERY PRETTY AND INTERESTING ESPECIALLY AT THE POINT WHERE THE RIVALS SUDDENLY RECOGNIZED ONE ANOTHER AND THE LADIES LOOKED AGITATED CHARMING SAID ANNA P VLOVNA WITH AN INQUIRING GLANCE AT THE LITTLE PRINCESS CHARMING WHISPERED THE LITTLE PRINCESS STICKING THE NEEDLE INTO HER WORK AS IF TO TESTIFY THAT THE INTEREST AND FASCINATION OF THE STORY PREVENTED HER FROM GOING ON WITH IT THE VICOMTE APPRECIATED THIS SILENT PRAISE AND SMILING GRATEFULLY PREPARED TO CONTINUE BUT JUST THEN ANNA P VLOVNA WHO HAD KEPT A WATCHFUL EYE ON THE YOUNG MAN WHO SO ALARMED HER NOTICED THAT HE WAS TALKING TOO LOUDLY AND VEHEMENTLY WITH THE ABB SO SHE HURRIED TO THE RESCUE PIERRE HAD MANAGED TO START A CONVERSATION WITH THE ABB ABOUT THE BALANCE OF POWER AND THE LATTER EVIDENTLY INTERESTED BY THE YOUNG MAN S SIMPLE MINDED EAGERNESS WAS EXPLAINING HIS PET THEORY BOTH WERE TALKING AND LISTENING TOO EAGERLY AND TOO NATURALLY WHICH WAS WHY ANNA P VLOVNA DISAPPROVED THE MEANS ARE THE BALANCE OF POWER IN EUROPE AND THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLE THE ABB WAS SAYING IT IS ONLY NECESSARY FOR ONE POWERFUL NATION LIKE RUSSIA BARBARIC AS SHE IS SAID TO BE TO PLACE HERSELF DISINTERESTEDLY AT THE HEAD OF AN ALLIANCE HAVING FOR ITS OBJECT THE MAINTENANCE OF THE BALANCE OF POWER OF EUROPE AND IT WOULD SAVE THE WORLD BUT HOW ARE YOU TO GET THAT BALANCE PIERRE WAS BEGINNING AT THAT MOMENT ANNA P VLOVNA CAME UP AND LOOKING SEVERELY AT PIERRE ASKED THE ITALIAN HOW HE STOOD RUSSIAN CLIMATE THE ITALIAN S FACE INSTANTLY CHANGED AND ASSUMED AN OFFENSIVELY AFFECTED SUGARY EXPRESSION EVIDENTLY HABITUAL TO HIM WHEN CONVERSING WITH WOMEN I AM SO ENCHANTED BY THE BRILLIANCY OF THE WIT AND CULTURE OF THE SOCIETY MORE ESPECIALLY OF THE FEMININE SOCIETY IN WHICH I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF BEING RECEIVED THAT I HAVE NOT YET HAD TIME TO THINK OF THE CLIMATE SAID HE NOT LETTING THE ABB AND PIERRE ESCAPE ANNA P VLOVNA THE MORE CONVENIENTLY TO KEEP THEM UNDER OBSERVATION BROUGHT THEM INTO THE LARGER CIRCLE CHAPTER IV JUST THEN ANOTHER VISITOR ENTERED THE DRAWING ROOM PRINCE ANDREW BOLK NSKI THE LITTLE PRINCESS HUSBAND HE WAS A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG MAN OF MEDIUM HEIGHT WITH FIRM CLEARCUT FEATURES

APPARENTLY SHE HAD FORGOTTEN HER AGE AND BY FORCE OF HABIT EMPLOYED ALL THE OLD FEMININE ARTS BUT AS SOON AS THE PRINCE HAD GONE HER FACE RESUMED ITS FORMER COLD ARTIFICIAL EXPRESSION SHE RETURNED TO THE GROUP WHERE THE VICOMTE WAS STILL TALKING AND AGAIN PRETENDED TO LISTEN WHILE WAITING TILL IT WOULD BE TIME TO LEAVE HER TASK WAS ACCOMPLISHED CHAPTER V AND WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS LATEST COMEDY THE CORONATION AT MILAN ASKED ANNA P VLOVNA AND OF THE COMEDY OF THE PEOPLE OF GENOA AND LUCCA LAYING THEIR PETITIONS BEFORE MONSIEUR BUONAPARTE AND MONSIEUR BUONAPARTE SITTING ON A THRONE AND GRANTING THE PETITIONS OF THE NATIONS ADORABLE IT IS ENOUGH TO MAKE ONE S HEAD WHIRL IT IS AS IF THE WHOLE WORLD HAD GONE CRAZY PRINCE ANDREW LOOKED ANNA P VLOVNA STRAIGHT IN THE FACE WITH A SARCASTIC SMILE DIEU ME LA DONNE GARE QUI LA TOUCHE THEY SAY HE WAS VERY FINE WHEN HE SAID THAT HE REMARKED REPEATING THE WORDS IN ITALIAN DIO MI L HA DATO GUAI A CHI LA TOCCHI GOD HAS GIVEN IT TO ME LET HIM WHO TOUCHES IT BEWARE I HOPE THIS WILL PROVE THE LAST DROP THAT WILL MAKE THE GLASS RUN OVER ANNA P VLOVNA CONTINUED THE SOVEREIGNS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ENDURE THIS MAN WHO IS A MENACE TO EVERYTHING THE SOVEREIGNS I DO NOT SPEAK OF RUSSIA SAID THE VICOMTE POLITE BUT HOPELESS THE SOVEREIGNS MADAME WHAT HAVE THEY DONE FOR LOUIS XVII FOR THE QUEEN OR FOR MADAME ELIZABETH NOTHING AND HE BECAME MORE ANIMATED AND BELIEVE ME THEY ARE REAPING THE REWARD OF THEIR BETRAYAL OF THE BOURBON CAUSE THE SOVEREIGNS WHY THEY ARE SENDING AMBASSADORS TO COMPLIMENT THE USURPER AND SIGHING DISDAINFULLY HE AGAIN CHANGED HIS POSITION PRINCE HIPPOLYTE WHO HAD BEEN GAZING AT THE VICOMTE FOR SOME TIME THROUGH HIS LORGNETTE SUDDENLY TURNED COMPLETELY ROUND TOWARD THE LITTLE PRINCESS AND HAVING ASKED FOR A NEEDLE BEGAN TRACING THE COND COAT OF ARMS ON THE TABLE HE EXPLAINED THIS TO HER WITH AS MUCH GRAVITY AS IF SHE HAD ASKED HIM TO DO IT B TON DE GUEULES ENGR L DE GUEULES D AZUR MAISON COND SAID HE THE PRINCESS LISTENED SMILING IF BUONAPARTE REMAINS ON THE THRONE OF FRANCE A YEAR LONGER THE VICOMTE CONTINUED WITH THE AIR OF A MAN WHO IN A MATTER WITH WHICH HE IS BETTER ACQUAINTED THAN ANYONE ELSE DOES NOT LISTEN TO OTHERS BUT FOLLOWS THE CURRENT OF HIS OWN THOUGHTS THINGS WILL HAVE GONE TOO FAR BY INTRIGUES VIOLENCE EXILE AND EXECUTIONS FRENCH SOCIETY I MEAN GOOD FRENCH SOCIETY WILL HAVE BEEN FOREVER DESTROYED AND THEN HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND SPREAD OUT HIS HANDS PIERRE WISHED TO MAKE A REMARK FOR THE CONVERSATION INTERESTED HIM BUT ANNA P VLOVNA WHO HAD HIM UNDER OBSERVATION INTERRUPTED THE EMPEROR ALEXANDER SAID SHE WITH THE MELANCHOLY WHICH ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED ANY REFERENCE OF HERS TO THE IMPERIAL FAMILY HAS DECLARED THAT HE WILL LEAVE IT TO THE FRENCH PEOPLE THEMSELVES TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN FORM OF GOVERNMENT AND I BELIEVE THAT ONCE FREE FROM THE USURPER THE WHOLE NATION WILL CERTAINLY THROW ITSELF INTO THE ARMS OF ITS RIGHTFUL KING SHE CONCLUDED TRYING TO BE AMIABLE TO THE ROYALIST EMIGRANT THAT IS DOUBTFUL SAID PRINCE ANDREW MONSIEUR LE VICOMTE QUITE RIGHTLY SUPPOSES THAT MATTERS HAVE ALREADY GONE TOO FAR I THINK IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO RETURN TO THE OLD REGIME FROM WHAT I HAVE HEARD SAID PIERRE BLUSHING AND BREAKING INTO THE CONVERSATION ALMOST ALL THE ARISTOCRACY HAS ALREADY GONE OVER TO BONAPARTE S SIDE IT IS THE BUONAPARTISTS WHO SAY THAT REPLIED THE VICOMTE WITHOUT LOOKING AT PIERRE AT THE PRESENT TIME IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW THE REAL STATE OF FRENCH PUBLIC OPINION BONAPARTE HAS SAID SO REMARKED PRINCE ANDREW WITH A SARCASTIC SMILE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE DID NOT LIKE THE VICOMTE AND WAS AIMING HIS REMARKS AT HIM THOUGH WITHOUT LOOKING AT HIM I SHOWED THEM THE PATH TO GLORY BUT THEY DID NOT FOLLOW IT PRINCE ANDREW CONTINUED AFTER A SHORT SILENCE AGAIN QUOTING NAPOLEON S WORDS I OPENED MY ANTECHAMBERS AND THEY CROWDED IN I DO NOT KNOW HOW FAR HE WAS JUSTIFIED IN SAYING SO NOT IN THE LEAST REPLIED THE VICOMTE AFTER THE MURDER OF THE DUC EVEN THE MOST PARTIAL CEASED TO REGARD HIM AS A HERO IF TO SOME PEOPLE HE WENT ON TURNING TO ANNA P VLOVNA HE EVER WAS A HERO AFTER THE MURDER OF THE DUC THERE WAS ONE MARTYR MORE IN HEAVEN AND ONE HERO LESS ON EARTH BEFORE ANNA P VLOVNA AND THE OTHERS HAD TIME TO SMILE THEIR APPRECIATION OF THE VICOMTE S EPIGRAM PIERRE AGAIN BROKE INTO THE CONVERSATION AND THOUGH ANNA P VLOVNA FELT SURE HE WOULD SAY SOMETHING INAPPROPRIATE SHE WAS UNABLE TO STOP HIM THE EXECUTION OF THE DUC D ENGHIEN DECLARED MONSIEUR PIERRE WAS A POLITICAL NECESSITY AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT NAPOLEON SHOWED GREATNESS OF SOUL BY NOT FEARING TO TAKE ON HIMSELF THE WHOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THAT DEED DIEU MON DIEU MUTTERED ANNA P VLOVNA IN A TERRIFIED WHISPER WHAT MONSIEUR PIERRE DO YOU CONSIDER THAT ASSASSINATION SHOWS GREATNESS OF SOUL SAID THE LITTLE PRINCESS SMILING AND DRAWING HER WORK NEARER TO HER OH OH EXCLAIMED SEVERAL VOICES CAPITAL SAID PRINCE HIPPOLYTE IN ENGLISH AND BEGAN SLAPPING HIS KNEE WITH THE PALM OF HIS HAND THE VICOMTE MERELY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS PIERRE LOOKED SOLEMNLY AT HIS AUDIENCE OVER HIS SPECTACLES AND CONTINUED I SAY SO HE CONTINUED DESPERATELY BECAUSE THE BOURBONS FLED FROM THE REVOLUTION LEAVING THE PEOPLE TO ANARCHY AND NAPOLEON ALONE UNDERSTOOD THE REVOLUTION AND QUELLED IT AND SO FOR THE GENERAL GOOD HE COULD NOT STOP SHORT FOR THE SAKE OF ONE MAN S LIFE WON T YOU COME OVER TO THE OTHER TABLE SUGGESTED ANNA P VLOVNA BUT PIERRE CONTINUED HIS SPEECH WITHOUT HEEDING HER NO CRIED HE BECOMING MORE AND MORE EAGER NAPOLEON IS GREAT BECAUSE HE ROSE SUPERIOR TO THE REVOLUTION SUPPRESSED ITS ABUSES PRESERVED ALL THAT WAS GOOD IN IT EQUALITY OF CITIZENSHIP AND FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND OF THE PRESS AND ONLY FOR THAT REASON DID HE OBTAIN POWER YES IF HAVING OBTAINED POWER WITHOUT AVAILING HIMSELF OF IT TO COMMIT MURDER HE HAD RESTORED IT TO THE RIGHTFUL KING I SHOULD HAVE CALLED HIM A GREAT MAN REMARKED THE VICOMTE HE COULD NOT DO THAT THE PEOPLE ONLY GAVE HIM POWER THAT HE MIGHT RID THEM OF THE BOURBONS AND BECAUSE THEY SAW THAT HE WAS A GREAT MAN THE REVOLUTION WAS A GRAND THING CONTINUED MONSIEUR PIERRE BETRAYING BY THIS DESPERATE AND PROVOCATIVE PROPOSITION HIS EXTREME YOUTH AND HIS WISH TO EXPRESS ALL THAT WAS IN HIS MIND WHAT REVOLUTION AND REGICIDE A GRAND THING WELL AFTER THAT BUT WON T YOU COME TO THIS OTHER TABLE REPEATED ANNA P VLOVNA ROUSSEAU S CONTRAT SOCIAL SAID THE VICOMTE WITH A TOLERANT SMILE I AM NOT SPEAKING OF REGICIDE I AM SPEAKING ABOUT IDEAS YES IDEAS OF ROBBERY MURDER AND REGICIDE AGAIN INTERJECTED AN IRONICAL VOICE THOSE WERE EXTREMES NO DOUBT BUT THEY ARE NOT WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT WHAT IS IMPORTANT ARE THE RIGHTS OF MAN EMANCIPATION FROM PREJUDICES AND EQUALITY OF CITIZENSHIP AND ALL THESE IDEAS NAPOLEON HAS RETAINED IN FULL FORCE LIBERTY AND EQUALITY SAID THE VICOMTE CONTEMPTUOUSLY AS IF AT LAST DECIDING SERIOUSLY TO PROVE TO THIS YOUTH HOW FOOLISH HIS WORDS WERE HIGH SOUNDING WORDS WHICH HAVE LONG BEEN DISCREDITED WHO DOES NOT LOVE LIBERTY AND EQUALITY EVEN OUR SAVIOUR PREACHED LIBERTY AND EQUALITY HAVE PEOPLE SINCE THE REVOLUTION BECOME HAPPIER ON THE CONTRARY WE WANTED LIBERTY BUT BUONAPARTE HAS DESTROYED IT PRINCE ANDREW KEPT LOOKING WITH AN AMUSED SMILE FROM PIERRE TO THE VICOMTE AND FROM THE VICOMTE TO THEIR HOSTESS IN THE FIRST MOMENT OF PIERRE S OUTBURST ANNA P VLOVNA DESPITE HER SOCIAL EXPERIENCE WAS HORROR STRUCK BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT PIERRE S SACRILEGIOUS WORDS HAD NOT EXASPERATED THE VICOMTE AND HAD CONVINCED HERSELF THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO STOP HIM SHE RALLIED HER FORCES AND JOINED THE VICOMTE IN A VIGOROUS ATTACK ON THE ORATOR BUT MY DEAR MONSIEUR PIERRE SAID SHE HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THE FACT OF A GREAT MAN EXECUTING A DUC OR EVEN AN ORDINARY MAN WHO IS INNOCENT AND UNTRIED I SHOULD LIKE SAID THE VICOMTE TO ASK HOW MONSIEUR EXPLAINS THE TH BRUMAIRE WAS NOT THAT AN IMPOSTURE IT WAS A SWINDLE AND NOT AT ALL LIKE THE CONDUCT OF A GREAT MAN AND THE PRISONERS HE KILLED IN AFRICA THAT WAS HORRIBLE SAID THE LITTLE PRINCESS SHRUGGING HER SHOULDERS HE S A LOW FELLOW SAY WHAT YOU WILL REMARKED PRINCE HIPPOLYTE PIERRE NOT KNOWING WHOM TO ANSWER LOOKED AT THEM ALL AND SMILED HIS SMILE WAS UNLIKE THE HALF SMILE OF OTHER PEOPLE WHEN HE SMILED HIS GRAVE EVEN RATHER GLOOMY LOOK WAS INSTANTANEOUSLY REPLACED BY ANOTHER A CHILDLIKE KINDLY EVEN RATHER SILLY LOOK WHICH SEEMED TO ASK FORGIVENESS THE VICOMTE WHO WAS MEETING HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME SAW CLEARLY THAT THIS YOUNG JACOBIN WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE AS HIS WORDS SUGGESTED ALL WERE SILENT HOW DO YOU EXPECT HIM TO ANSWER YOU ALL AT ONCE SAID PRINCE ANDREW BESIDES IN THE ACTIONS OF A STATESMAN ONE HAS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN HIS ACTS AS A PRIVATE PERSON AS A GENERAL AND AS AN EMPEROR SO IT SEEMS TO ME YES YES OF COURSE PIERRE CHIMED IN PLEASED AT THE ARRIVAL OF THIS REINFORCEMENT ONE MUST ADMIT CONTINUED PRINCE ANDREW THAT NAPOLEON AS A MAN WAS GREAT ON THE BRIDGE OF ARCOLA AND IN THE HOSPITAL AT JAFFA WHERE HE GAVE HIS HAND TO THE PLAGUE STRICKEN BUT BUT THERE ARE OTHER ACTS WHICH IT IS DIFFICULT TO JUSTIFY PRINCE ANDREW WHO HAD EVIDENTLY WISHED TO TONE DOWN THE AWKWARDNESS OF PIERRE S REMARKS ROSE AND MADE A SIGN TO HIS WIFE THAT IT WAS TIME TO GO SUDDENLY PRINCE HIPPOLYTE STARTED UP MAKING SIGNS TO EVERYONE TO ATTEND AND ASKING THEM ALL TO BE SEATED BEGAN I WAS TOLD A CHARMING MOSCOW STORY TODAY AND MUST TREAT YOU TO IT EXCUSE ME VICOMTE I MUST TELL IT IN RUSSIAN OR THE POINT WILL BE LOST AND PRINCE HIPPOLYTE BEGAN TO TELL HIS STORY IN SUCH RUSSIAN AS A FRENCHMAN WOULD SPEAK AFTER SPENDING ABOUT A YEAR IN RUSSIA EVERYONE WAITED SO EMPHATICALLY AND EAGERLY DID HE DEMAND THEIR ATTENTION TO HIS STORY THERE IS IN MOSCOW A LADY UNE DAME AND SHE IS VERY STINGY SHE MUST HAVE TWO FOOTMEN BEHIND HER CARRIAGE AND VERY BIG ONES THAT WAS HER TASTE AND SHE HAD A LADY S MAID ALSO BIG SHE SAID HERE PRINCE HIPPOLYTE PAUSED EVIDENTLY COLLECTING HIS IDEAS WITH DIFFICULTY SHE SAID OH YES SHE SAID GIRL TO THE MAID PUT ON A LIVERY GET UP BEHIND THE CARRIAGE AND COME WITH ME WHILE I MAKE SOME CALLS HERE PRINCE HIPPOLYTE SPLUTTERED AND BURST OUT LAUGHING LONG BEFORE HIS AUDIENCE WHICH PRODUCED AN EFFECT UNFAVORABLE TO THE NARRATOR SEVERAL PERSONS AMONG THEM THE ELDERLY LADY AND ANNA P VLOVNA DID HOWEVER SMILE SHE WENT SUDDENLY THERE WAS A GREAT WIND THE GIRL LOST HER HAT AND HER LONG HAIR CAME DOWN HERE HE COULD CONTAIN HIMSELF NO LONGER AND WENT ON BETWEEN GASPS OF LAUGHTER AND THE WHOLE WORLD KNEW AND SO THE ANECDOTE ENDED THOUGH IT WAS UNINTELLIGIBLE WHY HE HAD TOLD IT OR WHY IT HAD TO BE TOLD IN RUSSIAN STILL ANNA P VLOVNA AND THE OTHERS APPRECIATED PRINCE HIPPOLYTE S SOCIAL TACT IN SO AGREEABLY ENDING PIERRE S UNPLEASANT AND UNAMIABLE OUTBURST AFTER THE ANECDOTE THE CONVERSATION BROKE UP INTO INSIGNIFICANT SMALL TALK ABOUT THE LAST AND NEXT BALLS ABOUT THEATRICALS AND WHO WOULD MEET WHOM AND WHEN AND WHERE CHAPTER VI HAVING THANKED ANNA P VLOVNA FOR HER CHARMING SOIREE THE GUESTS BEGAN TO TAKE THEIR LEAVE PIERRE WAS UNGAINLY STOUT ABOUT THE AVERAGE HEIGHT BROAD WITH HUGE RED HANDS HE DID NOT KNOW AS THE SAYING IS HOW TO ENTER A DRAWING ROOM AND STILL LESS HOW TO LEAVE

IT PULLING AT THE PLUME TILL THE GENERAL ASKED HIM TO RESTORE IT ALL HIS ABSENT MINDEDNESS AND INABILITY TO ENTER A ROOM AND CONVERSE IN IT WAS HOWEVER REDEEMED BY HIS KINDLY SIMPLE AND MODEST

LONG HAD SOMETHING ON HIS MIND AND SUDDENLY DETERMINES TO SPEAK OUT NEVER NEVER MARRY MY DEAR FELLOW THAT S MY ADVICE NEVER MARRY TILL YOU CAN SAY TO YOURSELF THAT YOU HAVE DONE ALL YOU ARE CAPABLE OF

OF THOSE RARE WOMEN WITH WHOM A MAN S HONOR IS SAFE BUT O GOD WHAT WOULD I NOT GIVE NOW TO BE UNMARRIED YOU ARE THE FIRST AND ONLY ONE TO WHOM I MENTION THIS BECAUSE I LIKE YOU AS HE SAID THIS PRINCE ANDREW WAS LESS THAN EVER LIKE THAT BOLK NSKI WHO HAD LOLLED IN ANNA P VLOVNA S EASY CHAIRS AND WITH HALF CLOSED EYES HAD UTTERED FRENCH PHRASES BETWEEN HIS TEETH EVERY MUSCLE OF HIS THIN FACE WAS NOW QUIVERING WITH NERVOUS EXCITEMENT HIS EYES IN WHICH THE FIRE OF LIFE HAD SEEMED EXTINGUISHED NOW FLASHED WITH BRILLIANT LIGHT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE MORE LIFELESS HE SEEMED AT ORDINARY TIMES THE MORE IMPASSIONED HE BECAME IN THESE MOMENTS OF ALMOST MORBID IRRITATION YOU DON T UNDERSTAND WHY I SAY THIS HE CONTINUED BUT IT IS THE WHOLE STORY OF LIFE YOU TALK OF BONAPARTE AND HIS CAREER SAID HE THOUGH PIERRE HAD NOT MENTIONED BONAPARTE BUT BONAPARTE WHEN HE WORKED WENT STEP BY STEP TOWARD HIS GOAL HE WAS FREE HE HAD NOTHING BUT HIS AIM TO CONSIDER AND HE REACHED IT BUT TIE YOURSELF UP WITH A

SPOILED LIFE YOU HAVE EVERYTHING BEFORE YOU EVERYTHING AND YOU HE DID NOT FINISH HIS SENTENCE BUT HIS TONE SHOWED HOW HIGHLY HE THOUGHT OF HIS FRIEND AND HOW MUCH HE EXPECTED OF HIM IN THE FUTURE HOW

DESCRIBED AS STRENGTH OF WILL PIERRE WAS ALWAYS ASTONISHED AT PRINCE ANDREW S CALM MANNER OF TREATING EVERYBODY HIS EXTRAORDINARY MEMORY HIS EXTENSIVE READING HE HAD READ EVERYTHING KNEW EVERYTHING AND HAD AN OPINION ABOUT EVERYTHING BUT ABOVE ALL AT HIS CAPACITY FOR WORK AND STUDY AND IF PIERRE WAS OFTEN STRUCK BY ANDREW S LACK OF CAPACITY FOR PHILOSOPHICAL MEDITATION TO WHICH HE HIMSELF WAS PARTICULARLY ADDICTED HE REGARDED EVEN THIS NOT AS A DEFECT BUT AS A SIGN OF STRENGTH EVEN IN THE BEST MOST FRIENDLY AND SIMPLEST RELATIONS OF LIFE PRAISE AND COMMENDATION ARE ESSENTIAL JUST AS GREASE IS NECESSARY TO WHEELS THAT THEY MAY RUN SMOOTHLY MY PART IS PLAYED OUT SAID PRINCE ANDREW WHAT S THE USE OF TALKING ABOUT ME LET US TALK ABOUT YOU HE ADDED AFTER A SILENCE SMILING AT HIS REASSURING THOUGHTS THAT SMILE WAS IMMEDIATELY REFLECTED ON PIERRE S FACE BUT WHAT IS THERE TO SAY ABOUT ME SAID PIERRE HIS FACE RELAXING INTO A CARELESS MERRY SMILE WHAT AM I AN ILLEGITIMATE SON HE SUDDENLY

THERE WAS GENERALLY A DRINKING BOUT FINISHING WITH VISITS OF A KIND PIERRE WAS VERY FOND OF I SHOULD LIKE TO GO TO KUR GIN S THOUGHT HE BUT HE IMMEDIATELY RECALLED HIS PROMISE TO PRINCE ANDREW NOT TO GO THERE THEN AS HAPPENS TO PEOPLE OF WEAK CHARACTER HE DESIRED SO PASSIONATELY ONCE MORE TO ENJOY THAT DISSIPATION HE WAS SO ACCUSTOMED TO THAT HE DECIDED TO GO THE THOUGHT IMMEDIATELY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HIS PROMISE TO PRINCE ANDREW WAS OF NO ACCOUNT BECAUSE BEFORE HE GAVE IT HE HAD ALREADY PROMISED PRINCE ANATOLE TO COME TO HIS GATHERING BESIDES THOUGHT HE ALL SUCH WORDS OF HONOR ARE CONVENTIONAL THINGS WITH NO DEFINITE MEANING ESPECIALLY IF ONE CONSIDERS THAT BY TOMORROW ONE MAY BE DEAD OR SOMETHING SO EXTRAORDINARY MAY HAPPEN TO ONE THAT HONOR AND DISHONOR WILL BE ALL THE SAME

ASSURED CASTING A RAPID GLANCE AT ALL THOSE IN THE ROOM AND NOTICING THE COUNT S CONFESSOR THERE SHE GLIDED UP TO HIM WITH A SORT OF AMBLE NOT EXACTLY BOWING YET SEEMING TO GROW SUDDENLY SMALLER AND RESPECTFULLY RECEIVED THE BLESSING FIRST OF ONE AND THEN OF ANOTHER PRIEST GOD BE THANKED THAT YOU ARE IN TIME SAID SHE TO ONE OF THE PRIESTS ALL WE RELATIVES HAVE BEEN IN SUCH ANXIETY THIS YOUNG MAN IS THE COUNT S SON SHE ADDED MORE SOFTLY WHAT A TERRIBLE MOMENT HAVING SAID THIS SHE WENT UP TO THE DOCTOR DEAR DOCTOR SAID SHE THIS YOUNG MAN IS THE COUNT S SON IS THERE ANY HOPE THE DOCTOR CAST A RAPID GLANCE UPWARDS AND SILENTLY SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS ANNA MIKH YLOVNA WITH JUST THE SAME MOVEMENT RAISED HER SHOULDERS AND EYES ALMOST CLOSING THE LATTER SIGHED AND MOVED AWAY FROM THE DOCTOR TO PIERRE TO HIM IN A PARTICULARLY RESPECTFUL AND TENDERLY SAD VOICE SHE SAID TRUST IN HIS MERCY AND POINTING OUT A SMALL SOFA FOR HIM TO SIT AND WAIT FOR HER SHE WENT SILENTLY TOWARD THE DOOR THAT EVERYONE WAS WATCHING AND IT CREAKED VERY SLIGHTLY AS SHE DISAPPEARED BEHIND IT PIERRE HAVING MADE UP HIS MIND TO OBEY HIS MONITRESS IMPLICITLY MOVED TOWARD THE SOFA SHE HAD INDICATED AS SOON AS ANNA MIKH YLOVNA HAD DISAPPEARED HE NOTICED THAT THE EYES OF ALL IN THE ROOM TURNED TO HIM WITH SOMETHING MORE THAN CURIOSITY AND SYMPATHY HE NOTICED THAT THEY WHISPERED TO ONE ANOTHER CASTING SIGNIFICANT LOOKS AT HIM WITH A KIND OF AWE AND EVEN SERVILITY A DEFERENCE SUCH AS HE HAD NEVER BEFORE RECEIVED WAS SHOWN HIM A STRANGE LADY THE ONE WHO HAD BEEN TALKING TO THE PRIESTS ROSE AND OFFERED HIM HER SEAT AN AIDE DE CAMP PICKED UP AND RETURNED A GLOVE PIERRE HAD DROPPED THE DOCTORS BECAME RESPECTFULLY SILENT AS HE PASSED BY AND MOVED TO MAKE WAY FOR HIM AT FIRST PIERRE WISHED TO TAKE ANOTHER SEAT SO AS NOT TO TROUBLE THE LADY AND ALSO TO PICK UP THE GLOVE HIMSELF AND TO PASS ROUND THE DOCTORS WHO WERE NOT EVEN IN HIS WAY BUT ALL AT ONCE HE FELT THAT THIS WOULD NOT DO AND THAT TONIGHT HE WAS A PERSON OBLIGED TO PERFORM SOME SORT OF AWFUL RITE WHICH EVERYONE EXPECTED OF HIM AND THAT HE WAS THEREFORE BOUND TO ACCEPT THEIR SERVICES HE TOOK THE GLOVE IN SILENCE FROM THE AIDE DE CAMP AND SAT DOWN IN THE LADY S CHAIR PLACING HIS HUGE HANDS SYMMETRICALLY ON HIS KNEES IN THE NA VE ATTITUDE OF AN EGYPTIAN STATUE AND DECIDED IN HIS OWN MIND THAT ALL WAS AS IT SHOULD BE AND THAT IN ORDER NOT TO LOSE HIS HEAD AND DO FOOLISH THINGS HE MUST NOT ACT ON HIS OWN IDEAS TONIGHT BUT MUST YIELD HIMSELF UP ENTIRELY TO THE WILL OF THOSE WHO WERE GUIDING HIM NOT TWO MINUTES HAD PASSED BEFORE PRINCE VAS LI WITH HEAD ERECT MAJESTICALLY ENTERED THE ROOM HE WAS WEARING HIS LONG COAT WITH THREE STARS ON HIS BREAST HE SEEMED TO HAVE GROWN THINNER SINCE THE MORNING HIS EYES SEEMED LARGER THAN USUAL WHEN HE GLANCED ROUND AND NOTICED PIERRE HE WENT UP TO HIM TOOK HIS HAND A THING HE NEVER USED TO DO AND DREW IT DOWNWARDS AS IF WISHING TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER IT WAS FIRMLY FIXED ON COURAGE COURAGE MY FRIEND HE HAS ASKED TO SEE YOU THAT IS WELL AND HE TURNED TO GO BUT PIERRE THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO ASK HOW IS AND HESITATED NOT KNOWING WHETHER IT WOULD BE PROPER TO CALL THE DYING MAN THE COUNT YET ASHAMED TO CALL HIM FATHER HE HAD ANOTHER STROKE ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO COURAGE MY FRIEND PIERRE S MIND WAS IN SUCH A CONFUSED STATE THAT THE WORD STROKE SUGGESTED TO HIM A BLOW FROM SOMETHING HE LOOKED AT PRINCE VAS LI IN PERPLEXITY AND ONLY LATER GRASPED THAT A STROKE WAS AN ATTACK OF ILLNESS PRINCE VAS LI SAID SOMETHING TO LORRAIN IN PASSING AND WENT THROUGH THE DOOR ON TIPTOE HE COULD NOT WALK WELL ON TIPTOE AND HIS WHOLE BODY JERKED AT EACH STEP THE ELDEST PRINCESS FOLLOWED HIM AND THE PRIESTS AND DEACONS AND SOME SERVANTS ALSO WENT IN AT THE DOOR THROUGH THAT DOOR WAS HEARD A NOISE OF THINGS BEING MOVED ABOUT AND AT LAST ANNA MIKH YLOVNA STILL WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION PALE BUT RESOLUTE IN THE DISCHARGE OF DUTY RAN OUT AND TOUCHING PIERRE LIGHTLY ON THE ARM SAID THE DIVINE MERCY IS INEXHAUSTIBLE UNCTION IS ABOUT TO BE ADMINISTERED COME PIERRE WENT IN AT THE DOOR STEPPING ON THE SOFT CARPET AND NOTICED THAT THE STRANGE LADY THE AIDE DE CAMP AND SOME OF THE SERVANTS ALL FOLLOWED HIM IN AS IF THERE WERE NOW NO FURTHER NEED FOR PERMISSION TO ENTER THAT ROOM CHAPTER XXIII PIERRE WELL KNEW THIS LARGE ROOM DIVIDED BY COLUMNS AND AN ARCH ITS WALLS HUNG ROUND WITH PERSIAN CARPETS THE PART OF THE ROOM BEHIND THE COLUMNS WITH A HIGH SILK CURTAINED MAHOGANY BEDSTEAD ON ONE SIDE AND ON THE OTHER AN IMMENSE CASE CONTAINING ICONS WAS BRIGHTLY ILLUMINATED WITH RED LIGHT LIKE A RUSSIAN CHURCH DURING EVENING SERVICE UNDER THE GLEAMING ICONS STOOD A LONG INVALID CHAIR AND IN THAT CHAIR ON SNOWY WHITE SMOOTH PILLOWS EVIDENTLY FRESHLY CHANGED PIERRE SAW COVERED TO THE WAIST BY A BRIGHT GREEN QUILT THE FAMILIAR MAJESTIC FIGURE OF HIS FATHER COUNT BEZ KHOV WITH THAT GRAY MANE OF HAIR ABOVE HIS BROAD FOREHEAD WHICH REMINDED ONE OF A LION AND THE DEEP CHARACTERISTICALLY NOBLE WRINKLES OF HIS HANDSOME RUDDY FACE HE LAY JUST UNDER THE ICONS HIS LARGE THICK HANDS OUTSIDE THE QUILT INTO THE RIGHT HAND WHICH WAS LYING PALM DOWNWARDS A WAX TAPER HAD BEEN THRUST BETWEEN FOREFINGER AND THUMB AND AN OLD SERVANT BENDING OVER FROM BEHIND THE CHAIR HELD IT IN POSITION BY THE CHAIR STOOD THE PRIESTS THEIR LONG HAIR FALLING OVER THEIR MAGNIFICENT GLITTERING VESTMENTS WITH LIGHTED TAPERS IN THEIR HANDS SLOWLY AND SOLEMNLY CONDUCTING THE SERVICE A LITTLE BEHIND THEM STOOD THE TWO YOUNGER PRINCESSES HOLDING HANDKERCHIEFS TO THEIR EYES AND JUST IN FRONT OF THEM THEIR ELDEST SISTER CATICHE WITH A VICIOUS AND DETERMINED LOOK STEADILY FIXED ON THE ICONS AS THOUGH DECLARING TO ALL THAT SHE COULD NOT ANSWER FOR HERSELF SHOULD SHE GLANCE ROUND ANNA MIKH YLOVNA WITH A MEEK SORROWFUL AND ALL FORGIVING EXPRESSION ON HER FACE STOOD BY THE DOOR NEAR THE STRANGE LADY PRINCE VAS LI IN FRONT OF THE DOOR NEAR THE INVALID CHAIR A WAX TAPER IN HIS LEFT HAND WAS LEANING HIS LEFT ARM ON THE CARVED BACK OF A VELVET CHAIR HE HAD TURNED ROUND FOR THE PURPOSE AND WAS CROSSING HIMSELF WITH HIS RIGHT HAND TURNING HIS EYES UPWARD EACH TIME HE TOUCHED HIS FOREHEAD HIS FACE WORE A CALM LOOK OF PIETY AND RESIGNATION TO THE WILL OF GOD IF YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND THESE SENTIMENTS HE SEEMED TO BE SAYING SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR YOU BEHIND HIM STOOD THE AIDE DE CAMP THE DOCTORS AND THE MENSERVANTS THE MEN AND WOMEN HAD SEPARATED AS IN CHURCH ALL WERE SILENTLY CROSSING THEMSELVES AND THE READING OF THE CHURCH SERVICE THE SUBDUED CHANTING OF DEEP BASS VOICES AND IN THE INTERVALS SIGHS AND THE SHUFFLING OF FEET WERE THE ONLY SOUNDS THAT COULD BE HEARD ANNA MIKH YLOVNA WITH AN AIR OF IMPORTANCE THAT SHOWED THAT SHE FELT SHE QUITE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS ABOUT WENT ACROSS THE ROOM TO WHERE PIERRE WAS STANDING AND GAVE HIM A TAPER HE LIT IT AND DISTRACTED BY OBSERVING THOSE AROUND HIM BEGAN CROSSING HIMSELF WITH THE HAND THAT HELD THE TAPER SOPHIE THE ROSY LAUGHTER LOVING YOUNGEST PRINCESS WITH THE MOLE WATCHED HIM SHE SMILED HID HER FACE IN HER HANDKERCHIEF AND REMAINED WITH IT HIDDEN FOR AWHILE THEN LOOKING UP AND SEEING PIERRE SHE AGAIN BEGAN TO LAUGH SHE EVIDENTLY FELT UNABLE TO LOOK AT HIM WITHOUT LAUGHING BUT COULD NOT RESIST LOOKING AT HIM SO TO BE OUT OF TEMPTATION SHE SLIPPED QUIETLY BEHIND ONE OF THE COLUMNS IN THE MIDST OF THE SERVICE THE VOICES OF THE PRIESTS SUDDENLY CEASED THEY WHISPERED TO ONE ANOTHER AND THE OLD SERVANT WHO WAS HOLDING THE COUNT S HAND GOT UP AND SAID SOMETHING TO THE LADIES ANNA MIKH YLOVNA STEPPED FORWARD AND STOOPING OVER THE DYING MAN BECKONED TO LORRAIN FROM BEHIND HER BACK THE FRENCH DOCTOR HELD NO TAPER HE WAS LEANING AGAINST ONE OF THE COLUMNS IN A RESPECTFUL ATTITUDE IMPLYING THAT HE A FOREIGNER IN SPITE OF ALL DIFFERENCES OF FAITH UNDERSTOOD THE FULL IMPORTANCE OF THE RITE NOW BEING PERFORMED AND EVEN APPROVED OF IT HE NOW APPROACHED THE SICK MAN WITH THE NOISELESS STEP OF ONE IN FULL VIGOR OF LIFE WITH HIS DELICATE WHITE FINGERS RAISED FROM THE GREEN QUILT THE HAND THAT WAS FREE AND TURNING SIDEWAYS FELT THE PULSE AND REFLECTED A MOMENT THE SICK MAN WAS GIVEN SOMETHING TO DRINK THERE WAS A STIR AROUND HIM THEN THE PEOPLE RESUMED THEIR PLACES AND THE SERVICE CONTINUED DURING THIS INTERVAL PIERRE NOTICED THAT PRINCE VAS LI LEFT THE CHAIR ON WHICH HE HAD BEEN LEANING AND WITH AN AIR WHICH INTIMATED THAT HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS ABOUT AND IF OTHERS DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM IT WAS SO MUCH THE WORSE FOR THEM DID NOT GO UP TO THE DYING MAN BUT PASSED BY HIM JOINED THE ELDEST PRINCESS AND MOVED WITH HER TO THE SIDE OF THE ROOM WHERE STOOD THE HIGH BEDSTEAD WITH ITS SILKEN HANGINGS ON LEAVING THE BED BOTH PRINCE VAS LI AND THE PRINCESS PASSED OUT BY A BACK DOOR BUT RETURNED TO THEIR PLACES ONE AFTER THE OTHER BEFORE THE SERVICE WAS CONCLUDED PIERRE PAID NO MORE ATTENTION TO THIS OCCURRENCE THAN TO THE REST OF WHAT WENT ON HAVING MADE UP HIS MIND ONCE FOR ALL THAT WHAT HE SAW HAPPENING AROUND HIM THAT EVENING WAS IN SOME WAY ESSENTIAL THE CHANTING OF THE SERVICE CEASED AND THE VOICE OF THE PRIEST WAS HEARD RESPECTFULLY CONGRATULATING THE DYING MAN ON HAVING RECEIVED THE SACRAMENT THE DYING MAN LAY AS LIFELESS AND IMMOVABLE AS BEFORE AROUND HIM EVERYONE BEGAN TO STIR STEPS WERE AUDIBLE AND WHISPERS AMONG WHICH ANNA MIKH YLOVNA S WAS THE MOST DISTINCT PIERRE HEARD HER SAY CERTAINLY HE MUST BE MOVED ONTO THE BED HERE IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE THE SICK MAN WAS SO SURROUNDED BY DOCTORS PRINCESSES AND SERVANTS THAT PIERRE COULD NO LONGER SEE THE REDDISH YELLOW FACE WITH ITS GRAY MANE WHICH THOUGH HE SAW OTHER FACES AS WELL HE HAD NOT LOST SIGHT OF FOR A SINGLE MOMENT DURING THE WHOLE SERVICE HE JUDGED BY THE CAUTIOUS MOVEMENTS OF THOSE WHO CROWDED ROUND THE INVALID CHAIR THAT THEY HAD LIFTED THE DYING MAN AND WERE MOVING HIM CATCH HOLD OF MY ARM OR YOU LL DROP HIM HE HEARD ONE OF THE SERVANTS SAY IN A FRIGHTENED WHISPER CATCH HOLD FROM UNDERNEATH HERE EXCLAIMED DIFFERENT VOICES AND THE HEAVY BREATHING OF THE BEARERS AND THE SHUFFLING OF THEIR FEET GREW MORE HURRIED AS IF THE WEIGHT THEY WERE CARRYING WERE TOO MUCH FOR THEM AS THE BEARERS AMONG WHOM WAS ANNA MIKH YLOVNA PASSED THE YOUNG MAN HE CAUGHT A MOMENTARY GLIMPSE BETWEEN THEIR HEADS AND BACKS OF THE DYING MAN S HIGH STOUT UNCOVERED CHEST AND POWERFUL SHOULDERS RAISED BY THOSE WHO WERE HOLDING HIM UNDER THE ARMPITS AND OF HIS GRAY CURLY LEONINE HEAD THIS HEAD WITH ITS REMARKABLY BROAD BROW AND CHEEKBONES ITS HANDSOME SENSUAL MOUTH AND ITS COLD MAJESTIC EXPRESSION WAS NOT DISFIGURED BY THE APPROACH OF DEATH IT WAS THE SAME AS PIERRE REMEMBERED IT THREE MONTHS BEFORE WHEN THE COUNT HAD SENT HIM TO PETERSBURG BUT NOW THIS HEAD WAS SWAYING HELPLESSLY WITH THE UNEVEN MOVEMENTS OF THE BEARERS AND THE COLD LISTLESS GAZE FIXED ITSELF UPON NOTHING AFTER A FEW MINUTES BUSTLE BESIDE THE HIGH BEDSTEAD THOSE WHO HAD CARRIED THE SICK MAN DISPERSED ANNA MIKH YLOVNA TOUCHED PIERRE S HAND AND SAID COME PIERRE WENT WITH HER TO THE BED ON WHICH THE SICK MAN HAD BEEN LAID IN A STATELY POSE IN KEEPING WITH THE CEREMONY JUST COMPLETED HE LAY WITH HIS HEAD PROPPED HIGH ON THE PILLOWS HIS HANDS WERE SYMMETRICALLY PLACED ON THE GREEN SILK QUILT THE PALMS DOWNWARD WHEN PIERRE CAME UP THE COUNT WAS GAZING STRAIGHT AT HIM BUT WITH A LOOK THE SIGNIFICANCE OF WHICH COULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD BY MORTAL MAN EITHER THIS LOOK MEANT NOTHING BUT THAT AS LONG AS ONE HAS EYES THEY MUST LOOK SOMEWHERE OR IT MEANT TOO MUCH PIERRE HESITATED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO AND GLANCED INQUIRINGLY AT HIS GUIDE ANNA MIKH YLOVNA MADE A HURRIED SIGN WITH HER EYES GLANCING AT THE SICK MAN S HAND AND MOVING HER LIPS AS IF TO SEND IT A KISS PIERRE CAREFULLY STRETCHING HIS NECK SO AS NOT TO TOUCH THE QUILT FOLLOWED HER SUGGESTION AND PRESSED HIS LIPS TO THE LARGE BONED FLESHY HAND NEITHER THE HAND NOR A SINGLE MUSCLE OF THE COUNT S FACE STIRRED ONCE MORE PIERRE LOOKED QUESTIONINGLY AT ANNA MIKH YLOVNA TO SEE WHAT HE WAS TO DO NEXT ANNA MIKH YLOVNA WITH HER EYES INDICATED A CHAIR THAT STOOD BESIDE THE BED PIERRE OBEDIENTLY SAT DOWN HIS EYES ASKING IF HE WERE DOING RIGHT ANNA MIKH YLOVNA NODDED APPROVINGLY AGAIN PIERRE FELL INTO THE NA VELY SYMMETRICAL POSE OF AN EGYPTIAN STATUE EVIDENTLY DISTRESSED THAT HIS STOUT AND CLUMSY BODY TOOK UP SO MUCH ROOM AND DOING HIS UTMOST TO LOOK AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE HE LOOKED AT THE COUNT WHO STILL GAZED AT THE SPOT WHERE PIERRE S FACE HAD BEEN BEFORE HE SAT DOWN ANNA MIKH YLOVNA INDICATED BY HER ATTITUDE HER CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE PATHETIC IMPORTANCE OF THESE LAST MOMENTS OF MEETING BETWEEN THE FATHER AND SON THIS LASTED ABOUT TWO MINUTES WHICH TO PIERRE SEEMED AN HOUR SUDDENLY THE BROAD MUSCLES AND LINES OF THE COUNT S FACE BEGAN TO TWITCH THE TWITCHING INCREASED THE HANDSOME MOUTH WAS DRAWN TO ONE SIDE ONLY NOW DID PIERRE REALIZE HOW NEAR DEATH HIS FATHER WAS AND FROM THAT DISTORTED MOUTH ISSUED AN INDISTINCT HOARSE SOUND ANNA MIKH YLOVNA LOOKED ATTENTIVELY AT THE SICK MAN S EYES TRYING TO GUESS WHAT HE WANTED SHE POINTED FIRST TO PIERRE THEN TO SOME DRINK THEN NAMED PRINCE VAS LI IN AN INQUIRING WHISPER THEN POINTED TO THE QUILT THE EYES AND FACE OF THE SICK MAN SHOWED IMPATIENCE HE MADE AN EFFORT TO LOOK AT THE SERVANT WHO STOOD CONSTANTLY AT THE HEAD OF THE BED WANTS TO TURN ON THE OTHER SIDE WHISPERED THE SERVANT AND GOT UP TO TURN THE COUNT S HEAVY BODY TOWARD THE WALL PIERRE ROSE TO HELP HIM WHILE THE COUNT WAS BEING TURNED OVER ONE OF HIS ARMS FELL BACK HELPLESSLY AND HE MADE A FRUITLESS EFFORT TO PULL IT FORWARD WHETHER HE NOTICED THE LOOK OF TERROR WITH WHICH PIERRE REGARDED THAT LIFELESS ARM OR WHETHER SOME OTHER THOUGHT FLITTED ACROSS HIS DYING BRAIN AT ANY RATE HE GLANCED AT THE REFRACTORY ARM AT PIERRE S TERROR STRICKEN FACE AND AGAIN AT THE ARM AND ON HIS FACE A FEEBLE PITEOUS SMILE APPEARED QUITE OUT OF KEEPING WITH HIS FEATURES THAT SEEMED TO DERIDE HIS OWN HELPLESSNESS AT SIGHT OF THIS SMILE PIERRE FELT AN UNEXPECTED QUIVERING IN HIS BREAST AND A TICKLING IN HIS NOSE AND TEARS DIMMED HIS EYES THE SICK MAN WAS TURNED ON TO HIS SIDE WITH HIS FACE TO THE WALL HE SIGHED HE IS DOZING SAID ANNA MIKH YLOVNA OBSERVING THAT ONE OF THE PRINCESSES WAS COMING TO TAKE HER TURN AT WATCHING LET US GO PIERRE WENT OUT CHAPTER XXIV THERE WAS NOW NO ONE IN THE RECEPTION ROOM EXCEPT PRINCE VAS LI AND THE ELDEST PRINCESS WHO WERE SITTING UNDER THE PORTRAIT OF CATHERINE THE GREAT AND TALKING EAGERLY AS SOON AS THEY SAW PIERRE AND HIS COMPANION THEY BECAME SILENT AND PIERRE THOUGHT HE SAW THE PRINCESS HIDE SOMETHING AS SHE WHISPERED I CAN T BEAR THE SIGHT OF THAT WOMAN CATICHE HAS HAD TEA SERVED IN THE SMALL DRAWING ROOM SAID PRINCE VAS LI TO ANNA MIKH YLOVNA GO AND TAKE SOMETHING MY POOR ANNA MIKH YLOVNA OR YOU WILL NOT HOLD OUT TO PIERRE HE SAID NOTHING MERELY GIVING HIS ARM A SYMPATHETIC SQUEEZE BELOW THE SHOULDER PIERRE WENT WITH ANNA MIKH YLOVNA INTO THE SMALL DRAWING ROOM THERE IS NOTHING SO REFRESHING AFTER A SLEEPLESS NIGHT AS A CUP OF THIS DELICIOUS RUSSIAN TEA LORRAIN WAS SAYING WITH AN AIR OF RESTRAINED ANIMATION AS HE STOOD SIPPING TEA FROM A DELICATE CHINESE HANDLELESS CUP BEFORE A TABLE ON WHICH TEA AND A COLD SUPPER WERE LAID IN THE SMALL CIRCULAR ROOM AROUND THE TABLE ALL WHO WERE AT COUNT BEZ KHOV S HOUSE THAT NIGHT HAD GATHERED TO FORTIFY THEMSELVES PIERRE WELL REMEMBERED THIS SMALL CIRCULAR DRAWING ROOM WITH ITS MIRRORS AND LITTLE TABLES DURING BALLS GIVEN AT THE HOUSE PIERRE WHO DID NOT KNOW HOW TO DANCE HAD LIKED SITTING IN THIS ROOM TO WATCH THE LADIES WHO AS THEY PASSED THROUGH IN THEIR BALL DRESSES WITH DIAMONDS AND PEARLS ON THEIR BARE SHOULDERS LOOKED AT THEMSELVES IN THE BRILLIANTLY LIGHTED MIRRORS WHICH REPEATED THEIR REFLECTIONS SEVERAL TIMES NOW THIS SAME ROOM WAS DIMLY LIGHTED BY TWO CANDLES ON ONE SMALL TABLE TEA THINGS AND SUPPER DISHES STOOD IN DISORDER AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT A MOTLEY THRONG OF PEOPLE SAT THERE NOT MERRYMAKING BUT SOMBERLY WHISPERING AND BETRAYING BY EVERY WORD AND MOVEMENT THAT THEY NONE OF THEM FORGOT WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN IN THE BEDROOM PIERRE DID NOT EAT ANYTHING THOUGH HE WOULD VERY MUCH HAVE LIKED TO HE LOOKED INQUIRINGLY AT HIS MONITRESS AND SAW THAT SHE WAS AGAIN GOING ON TIPTOE TO THE RECEPTION ROOM WHERE THEY HAD LEFT PRINCE VAS LI AND THE ELDEST PRINCESS PIERRE CONCLUDED THAT THIS ALSO WAS ESSENTIAL AND AFTER A SHORT INTERVAL FOLLOWED HER ANNA MIKH YLOVNA WAS STANDING BESIDE THE PRINCESS AND THEY WERE BOTH SPEAKING IN EXCITED WHISPERS PERMIT ME PRINCESS TO KNOW WHAT IS NECESSARY AND WHAT IS NOT NECESSARY SAID THE YOUNGER OF THE TWO SPEAKERS EVIDENTLY IN THE SAME STATE OF EXCITEMENT AS WHEN SHE HAD SLAMMED THE DOOR OF HER ROOM BUT MY DEAR PRINCESS ANSWERED ANNA MIKH YLOVNA BLANDLY BUT IMPRESSIVELY BLOCKING THE WAY TO THE BEDROOM AND PREVENTING THE OTHER FROM PASSING WON T THIS BE TOO MUCH FOR POOR UNCLE AT A MOMENT WHEN HE NEEDS REPOSE WORLDLY CONVERSATION AT A MOMENT WHEN HIS SOUL IS ALREADY PREPARED PRINCE VAS LI WAS SEATED IN AN EASY CHAIR IN HIS FAMILIAR ATTITUDE WITH ONE LEG CROSSED HIGH ABOVE THE OTHER HIS CHEEKS WHICH WERE SO FLABBY THAT THEY LOOKED HEAVIER BELOW WERE TWITCHING VIOLENTLY BUT HE WORE THE AIR OF A MAN LITTLE CONCERNED IN WHAT THE TWO LADIES WERE SAYING COME MY DEAR ANNA MIKH YLOVNA LET CATICHE DO AS SHE PLEASES YOU KNOW HOW FOND THE COUNT IS OF HER I DON T EVEN KNOW WHAT IS IN THIS PAPER SAID THE YOUNGER OF THE TWO LADIES ADDRESSING PRINCE VAS LI AND POINTING TO AN INLAID PORTFOLIO SHE HELD IN HER HAND ALL I KNOW IS THAT HIS REAL WILL IS IN HIS WRITING TABLE AND THIS IS A PAPER HE HAS FORGOTTEN SHE TRIED TO PASS ANNA MIKH YLOVNA BUT THE LATTER SPRANG SO AS TO BAR HER PATH I KNOW MY DEAR KIND PRINCESS SAID ANNA MIKH YLOVNA SEIZING THE PORTFOLIO SO FIRMLY THAT IT WAS PLAIN SHE WOULD NOT LET GO EASILY DEAR PRINCESS I BEG AND IMPLORE YOU HAVE SOME PITY ON HIM JE VOUS EN CONJURE THE PRINCESS DID NOT REPLY THEIR EFFORTS IN THE STRUGGLE FOR THE PORTFOLIO WERE THE ONLY SOUNDS AUDIBLE BUT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IF THE PRINCESS DID SPEAK HER WORDS WOULD NOT BE FLATTERING TO ANNA MIKH YLOVNA THOUGH THE LATTER HELD ON TENACIOUSLY HER VOICE LOST NONE OF ITS HONEYED FIRMNESS AND SOFTNESS PIERRE MY DEAR COME HERE I THINK HE WILL NOT BE OUT OF PLACE IN A FAMILY CONSULTATION IS IT NOT SO PRINCE WHY DON T YOU SPEAK COUSIN SUDDENLY SHRIEKED THE PRINCESS SO LOUD THAT THOSE IN

WHISPERS AND AS A GREAT SECRET CHAPTER XXV AT BALD HILLS PRINCE NICHOLAS ANDR EVICH BOLK NSKI S ESTATE THE ARRIVAL OF YOUNG PRINCE ANDREW AND HIS WIFE WAS DAILY EXPECTED BUT THIS EXPECTATION DID NOT UPSET THE REGULAR ROUTINE OF LIFE IN THE OLD PRINCE S HOUSEHOLD GENERAL IN CHIEF PRINCE NICHOLAS ANDR EVICH NICKNAMED IN SOCIETY THE KING OF PRUSSIA EVER SINCE THE EMPEROR PAUL HAD EXILED HIM TO HIS COUNTRY ESTATE HAD LIVED THERE CONTINUOUSLY WITH HIS DAUGHTER PRINCESS MARY AND HER COMPANION MADEMOISELLE BOURIENNE THOUGH IN THE NEW REIGN HE WAS FREE TO RETURN TO THE CAPITALS HE STILL CONTINUED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY REMARKING THAT ANYONE WHO WANTED TO SEE HIM COULD COME THE HUNDRED MILES FROM MOSCOW TO BALD HILLS WHILE HE HIMSELF NEEDED NO ONE AND NOTHING HE USED TO SAY THAT THERE ARE ONLY TWO SOURCES OF HUMAN VICE IDLENESS AND SUPERSTITION AND ONLY TWO VIRTUES ACTIVITY AND INTELLIGENCE HE HIMSELF UNDERTOOK HIS DAUGHTER S EDUCATION AND TO DEVELOP THESE TWO CARDINAL VIRTUES IN HER GAVE HER LESSONS IN ALGEBRA AND GEOMETRY TILL SHE WAS TWENTY AND ARRANGED HER LIFE SO THAT HER WHOLE TIME WAS OCCUPIED HE WAS HIMSELF ALWAYS OCCUPIED WRITING HIS MEMOIRS SOLVING PROBLEMS IN HIGHER MATHEMATICS TURNING SNUFFBOXES ON A LATHE WORKING IN THE GARDEN OR SUPERINTENDING THE BUILDING THAT WAS ALWAYS GOING ON AT HIS ESTATE AS REGULARITY IS A PRIME CONDITION FACILITATING ACTIVITY REGULARITY IN HIS HOUSEHOLD WAS CARRIED TO THE HIGHEST POINT OF EXACTITUDE HE ALWAYS CAME TO TABLE UNDER PRECISELY THE SAME CONDITIONS AND NOT ONLY AT THE SAME HOUR BUT AT THE SAME MINUTE WITH THOSE ABOUT HIM FROM HIS DAUGHTER TO HIS SERFS THE PRINCE WAS SHARP AND INVARIABLY EXACTING SO THAT WITHOUT BEING A HARDHEARTED MAN HE INSPIRED SUCH FEAR AND RESPECT AS FEW HARDHEARTED MEN WOULD HAVE AROUSED ALTHOUGH HE WAS IN RETIREMENT AND HAD NOW NO INFLUENCE IN POLITICAL AFFAIRS EVERY HIGH OFFICIAL APPOINTED TO THE PROVINCE IN WHICH THE PRINCE S ESTATE LAY CONSIDERED IT HIS DUTY TO VISIT HIM AND WAITED IN THE LOFTY ANTECHAMBER JUST AS THE ARCHITECT GARDENER OR PRINCESS MARY DID TILL THE PRINCE APPEARED PUNCTUALLY TO THE APPOINTED HOUR EVERYONE SITTING IN THIS ANTECHAMBER EXPERIENCED THE SAME FEELING OF RESPECT AND EVEN FEAR WHEN THE ENORMOUSLY HIGH STUDY DOOR OPENED AND SHOWED THE FIGURE OF A RATHER SMALL OLD MAN WITH POWDERED WIG SMALL WITHERED HANDS AND BUSHY GRAY EYEBROWS WHICH WHEN HE FROWNED SOMETIMES HID THE GLEAM OF HIS SHREWD YOUTHFULLY GLITTERING EYES ON THE MORNING OF THE DAY THAT THE YOUNG COUPLE WERE TO ARRIVE PRINCESS MARY ENTERED THE ANTECHAMBER AS USUAL AT THE TIME APPOINTED FOR THE MORNING GREETING CROSSING HERSELF WITH TREPIDATION AND REPEATING A SILENT PRAYER EVERY MORNING SHE CAME IN LIKE THAT AND EVERY MORNING PRAYED THAT THE DAILY INTERVIEW MIGHT PASS OFF WELL AN OLD

TOOLS LAID READY TO HAND AND SHAVINGS SCATTERED AROUND ALL INDICATED CONTINUOUS VARIED AND ORDERLY ACTIVITY THE MOTION OF THE SMALL FOOT SHOD IN A TARTAR BOOT EMBROIDERED WITH SILVER AND THE FIRM PRESSURE OF THE LEAN SINEWY HAND SHOWED THAT THE PRINCE STILL POSSESSED THE TENACIOUS ENDURANCE AND VIGOR OF HARDY OLD AGE AFTER A FEW MORE TURNS OF THE LATHE HE REMOVED HIS FOOT FROM THE PEDAL WIPED HIS CHISEL DROPPED IT INTO A LEATHER POUCH ATTACHED TO THE LATHE AND APPROACHING THE TABLE SUMMONED HIS DAUGHTER HE NEVER GAVE HIS CHILDREN A BLESSING SO HE SIMPLY HELD OUT HIS BRISTLY CHEEK AS YET UNSHAVEN AND REGARDING HER TENDERLY AND ATTENTIVELY SAID SEVERELY QUITE WELL ALL RIGHT THEN SIT DOWN HE TOOK THE EXERCISE BOOK CONTAINING LESSONS IN GEOMETRY WRITTEN BY HIMSELF AND DREW UP A CHAIR WITH HIS FOOT FOR TOMORROW SAID HE QUICKLY FINDING THE PAGE AND MAKING A SCRATCH FROM ONE PARAGRAPH TO ANOTHER WITH HIS HARD NAIL THE PRINCESS BENT OVER THE EXERCISE BOOK ON THE TABLE WAIT A BIT HERE

DREW TOWARD HIM THE EXERCISE BOOK CONTAINING GEOMETRICAL FIGURES WELL MADAM HE BEGAN STOOPING OVER THE BOOK CLOSE TO HIS DAUGHTER AND PLACING AN ARM ON THE BACK OF THE CHAIR ON WHICH SHE SAT SO THAT SHE FELT HERSELF SURROUNDED ON ALL SIDES BY THE ACRID SCENT OF OLD AGE AND TOBACCO WHICH SHE HAD KNOWN SO LONG NOW MADAM THESE TRIANGLES ARE EQUAL PLEASE NOTE THAT THE ANGLE ABC THE PRINCESS LOOKED IN A SCARED WAY AT HER FATHER S EYES GLITTERING CLOSE TO HER THE RED PATCHES ON HER FACE CAME AND WENT AND IT WAS PLAIN THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD NOTHING AND WAS SO FRIGHTENED THAT HER FEAR WOULD PREVENT HER UNDERSTANDING ANY OF HER FATHER S FURTHER EXPLANATIONS HOWEVER CLEAR THEY MIGHT BE WHETHER IT WAS THE TEACHER S FAULT OR THE PUPIL S THIS SAME THING HAPPENED EVERY DAY THE PRINCESS EYES GREW DIM SHE COULD NOT SEE AND COULD NOT HEAR ANYTHING BUT WAS ONLY CONSCIOUS OF HER STERN FATHER S WITHERED FACE CLOSE TO HER OF HIS BREATH AND THE SMELL OF HIM AND COULD THINK ONLY OF HOW TO GET AWAY QUICKLY TO
